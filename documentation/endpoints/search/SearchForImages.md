SearchForImages
-------------
The SearchForImages call returns image metadata for all images matching a
specified search query.

###Search queries and filters
SearchForImages partitions a search into a query and an optional set of filters. At
least one query must be provided. All filters are optional. This partitioning supports
the scenario where the client submits a query and the server responds with
suggested possible modifications to that query, in addition to the initial results. The
client can then resubmit the original query and provide any of the suggested
modifications as filters. It enables clients to create workflows that allow users to
interactively modify their search in response to suggestions that can improve the
quality of matches.

###Search pagination
Clients can control the subset of matching images returned in a response. This
feature supports pagination scenarios. The subset, or "page" of images returned is
specified by the client with an index: ItemStartNumber, and offset: ItemCount.

###Search hide/block
Hide/block restricts the items returned in a search result set to conform to legal
requirements and comply with image partner contracts based on the end user's
billing country.

####Workflow example: initial search
1. Call [CreateSession][] with system and user credentials to create an authentication token.
2. Call SearchForImages, providing the authentication token in the request header and specifying the query in the request body.
3. For an initial search, populate the following fields: <br>• Query.SearchPhrase <br>• ResultOptions.ItemCount <br>• ResultOptions.ItemStartNumber <br>• Leave Filter undefined.
4. Retrieve image metadata from the Images entries.
5. Retrieve refinement filters from the RefinementOptions entries if a refined search will be supported.

###Workflow example: refined search
Call SearchForImages, providing the same request as in the initial search, but with the following modification:

1. Add an entry to Filter.Refinements for desired refinement options.
2. Populate each Refinements entry's fields from the corresponding fields from the desired RefinementOptions entry.
3. Retrieve image metadata from the Images entries.
4. Retrieve refinement filters from the RefinementOptions entries if an additional refined search is supported.
